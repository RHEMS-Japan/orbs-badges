CHANGELOG.md LICENSE README.md src When ready to publish a new production version, create a Pull Request from _feature branch_ to `master`. CHANGELOG.md LICENSE README.md src The title of the pull request must contain a special semver tag: `[semver:<segment>]` where `<segment>` is replaced by one of the following values. | Increment | Description| | ----------| -----------| | major | Issue a 1.0.0 incremented release| | minor | Issue a x.1.0 incremented release| | patch | Issue a x.x.1 incremented release| | skip | Do not issue a release| Example: `[semver:major]` CHANGELOG.md LICENSE README.md src Squash and merge. Ensure the semver tag is preserved and entered as a part of the commit message. CHANGELOG.md LICENSE README.md src On merge, after manual approval, the orb will automatically be published to the Orb Registry.
